# Personal Site

I highly recommend viewing the site on a larger screen and not a mobile device for a better viewing experience. 


This is my first proper website and first time shipping a project! There were a lot of firsts making this, so if you have any suggestions please let me know! 

The music is automatically turned off on the homepage, press the button to hear fire beats.

## Tools
Made with HTML, CSS and JS
Hosted on GitHub



AI was lightly used to help me make this site.
